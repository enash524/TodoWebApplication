# The Challenge

* Using the tools and languages of your choice, create a simple to-do web application.
  * Sample data with tasks is provided in the attached file. You can use these tasks as a starting point
  * We do not require that the application connect to a database for this exercise (it might be a nice-to-have if there is enough time left on the call at the end)
* The application should allow a user to:
  * Create a task item
  * Edit a task item
  * Check off the task item
  * Remove the task item
  * If you have time to add additional features feel free to explain and show us
